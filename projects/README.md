# Overview
### To prepare for your IA, you will need to design a program to create a solution for a client. You must use functional programming, and your solution must contain at least two functions. Note, if you wish for a challenge you may use OOP.

# Steps for Completion
### You will write a paper of no more than 1000 words that details the following steps for your project completion. It is up to you to demonstrate that each step has been thoroughly completed. We will be using the IB rubric for the IA: section A and B. See slack for rubrics

# Project Milestones

- Identify Client
- Contact Client
- Interview Client
- Design solution: flowchart and pseudo code
- Create a prototype for the client to test
- Incorporate feedback from the client into the final solution

# Completion
### Your project will be considered complete when:
- You push your working program to GitHub
- Your paper is added to your Github repo as a [markdown file](https://github.com/adam-p/markdown-here/wiki/Markdown-Cheatsheet).
