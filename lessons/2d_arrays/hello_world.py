import random
my_nums = [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10]

# access the 5th element in my_nums

# create a sequential search function for my nums

# Explain how a binary search would work on my_nums


# list comp for 2D array
# sorted ints
sorted_matrix = [[col for col in range(6)] for row in range(10)]
# random ints
matrix = [[random.randint(0,100) for col in range(5)] for row in range(3)]
# access the number 0 in the first row

# access the last number in the last row

# save the middle col index value in a var


# save the middle row index value in a var


# access the middle number in the middle row


# Mild: create a function that will take in a 2D array and find the middle value


# Spicy: print the entire middle row

# Spicy: print the first value of every row

# Spicy: take in two 2D arrays and find the middle value of both

# Iterating over 2D arrays
my_nums = [[random.randint(0,500) for col in range(5)] for row in range(3)]

# mild: print out every single value in my_nums

# medium: replace all noneven numbers in my_nums with 0

# spicy: find the highest number in my_nums

# spicy plus: find the mean for my_nums

# Complete at least one. Create user documentation for how your function works:
